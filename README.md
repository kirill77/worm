# C. elegans Life Cycle Simulation

A comprehensive computational model simulating the complete life cycle of C. elegans, from zygote formation to natural death. This ambitious project aims to create a detailed molecular and cellular simulation of all developmental stages and aging processes in C. elegans.

## Project Vision

The goal is to create an end-to-end simulation of C. elegans development and aging, covering:
- Early embryogenesis (current focus)
- Larval development (L1-L4 stages)
- Adult development
- Reproductive period
- Aging and natural death

The simulation will track development at multiple scales:
- Molecular: Protein interactions and gene expression
- Cellular: Cell divisions, migrations, and differentiation
- Tissue: Organ formation and function
- Organism: Overall growth, behavior, and aging

## Current Implementation Status

The project currently focuses on early embryogenesis (first 20 minutes post-fertilization), including:
- PAR protein polarization
- Cell cycle regulation through CDK-1/Cyclin B
- Nuclear envelope dynamics
- Spindle positioning and asymmetric division

### Planned Development Stages

1. **Early Embryogenesis** (Current)
   - Zygote formation
   - First cell divisions
   - Initial cell fate determination

2. **Late Embryogenesis** (Planned)
   - Gastrulation
   - Tissue formation
   - Organ specification

3. **Larval Development** (Planned)
   - L1-L4 stage transitions
   - Molting processes
   - Cell lineage progression

4. **Adult Development** (Planned)
   - Reproductive system maturation
   - Behavioral circuit formation
   - Metabolic regulation

5. **Aging Process** (Planned)
   - Cellular deterioration
   - Protein aggregation
   - Tissue function decline
   - Natural death

## Key Features

### Current Protein Dynamics
- Anterior PAR proteins (PAR-3, PAR-6, PKC-3)
- Posterior PAR proteins (PAR-1, PAR-2)
- Cell cycle regulators (CDK-1, CYB-1)

### Chromosomal Organization
- Models all 6 C. elegans chromosomes
- Gene distribution across chromosomes:
  - Chromosome I: mex-3, plk-1
  - Chromosome II: skn-1, cyb-1
  - Chromosome III: pal-1, cdk-1
  - Chromosome IV: pie-1
  - Chromosomes V & X: Reserved for future genes

### Current Developmental Timeline
The simulation currently covers the first 20 minutes of zygote development with the following key events:
- 0-6 min: Initial PAR protein polarization
- 6-10 min: Polarity maintenance
- 12.5 min: Nuclear envelope breakdown
- 15 min: Spindle assembly
- 18.3 min: Cell division initiation

## Technical Details

### Simulation Parameters
- Timestep: 0.1 seconds
- Current simulation steps: 12,000 (20 minutes)
- Validation checks: Every 10 seconds

### Key Components
- `Worm`: Main organism class managing the simulation
- `Cell`: Represents individual cells
- `Medium`: Handles protein diffusion and interactions
- `Nucleus`: Manages nuclear dynamics
- `Spindle`: Controls mitotic spindle positioning
- `Chromosome`: Represents genetic material

### Validation Metrics
- PAR protein polarization ratio threshold: 3.0
- Nuclear size relative threshold: 0.8
- Asymmetric division ratio: 0.6

## Usage

```cpp
// Create and initialize the simulation
std::shared_ptr<Worm> pWorm = std::make_shared<Worm>();
World world(pWorm);

// Run simulation with validation
constexpr float fDtSec = 0.1f;
for (uint32_t u = 0; u < 12000; ++u) {
    world.simulateStep(fDtSec);
    // Validation checks occur every 10 seconds
}
```

## Validation

The simulation includes automatic validation of key developmental events:
1. PAR Protein Polarization
   - Verifies correct anterior-posterior protein localization
   - Checks concentration ratios against experimental thresholds

2. Cell Cycle Progression
   - Monitors CDK-1 levels throughout development
   - Validates proper timing of cell cycle transitions

3. Asymmetric Division
   - Checks spindle positioning
   - Verifies posterior displacement

## Roadmap
