Centrosome validation and Y_TuRC creation – next steps

Goal
- Align duplication validation and ring-complex (Y_TuRC) creation with in vivo biology while unblocking the current “0 rings” state.

Status update (current implementation)
- Done: maternal γ-tubulin seed at centrosome; species-consistent γ-tubulin lookup.
- Done: molecule-driven PCM maturation from local SPD-2/SPD-5 and kinases (PLK-1/AIR-1) with on/off kinetics.
- Done: γ-tubulin local enrichment driven by PCM maturation; Y_TuRC target ∝ PCM × γlocal (γ/50 scaled by PCM).
- Pending: replace conservative 6-min guard with S-phase + licensing markers (CYE-1/CDK-2 active, SPD-2 present, ZYG-1 localized; block after SAS-6).
- Pending: parameter tuning (k_on, k_off, K2/K5/Kp/Ka, k_rec, k_loss) and validation metrics for PCM/γ dynamics.

1) Replace time-based duplication guard with state-based gating
- Remove fixed minute cutoff. Gate duplication on:
  - S phase is active, and
  - Global kinase cue: CYE-1/CDK-2 activity present, and
  - Centrosomal licensing markers: SPD-2 at centrioles and ZYG-1 localized.
- Block re-duplication once SAS-6 (cartwheel) is present.
- Add TODO hooks to read these markers as we implement molecule localization.

2) Correct ring-complex creation inputs
- (Done) Ensure γ-tubulin is available at the centrosome position at t=0 (maternal provisioning) so target Y_TuRC > 0 before duplication.
- (Done) Confirm `Centrosome::update` queries γ-tubulin at exactly `m_toNormalizedCell.m_translation` with correct species.
- (Optional) Add one-time logs: γ-tubulin@centrosome, targetYTuRC, currentYTuRC; duplication attempts.

3) Add missing pathway molecules and (later) localization
- (Done) Add StringDict IDs/strings: ZYG_1, SPD_2, SPD_5, PCMD_1, SAS_6, SAS_5, SAS_4.
- (Partial) Provision maternal pools near posterior centrosome: SPD_2, SPD_5, PLK_1, AIR_1.
- (Pending) Provision PCMD_1, ZYG_1/SAS factors and implement localization dynamics used by the state gate.

4) PCM maturation model for γ-tubulin recruitment
- (Done) Introduce PCM maturation from SPD-2/5 and kinases (PLK-1/AIR-1) via on/off kinetics.
- (Done) Compute γ-tubulin local enrichment as a function of PCM maturation.
- (Done) Drive Y_TuRC target from PCM × γlocal (instead of fixed `/50`).
- (Pending) Tune parameters to reach stage plateaus (~10^3 early → ~10^4 at metaphase).

5) Validation additions
- Keep DataCollector’s `NucleationSites(Y_TuRC)` column.
- Add reporting of first duplication time and γ-tubulin@centrosome (and PCM proxy if exposed) to diagnose maturation and ring counts.

6) Future coupling to MTs and cortex (after validation passes)
- Implement AstralMT dynamic instability and cortex contact mapping.
- Use contacts to modulate cortex-bound molecule kinetics for polarization; independent of duplication guard.
