Centrosome duplication and PCM maturation in the C. elegans one-cell embryo (biological rationale + references)

Biological sequence (qualitative)
- Fertilization introduces paternal centrioles; meiosis completes; the embryo enters the first cell cycle.
- Centriole/centrosome duplication is licensed and occurs during S phase of the first embryonic cycle (not at time 0).
- Duplication competence depends on CYE-1 (Cyclin E)/CDK-2 activity. SPD-2 (CEP192) at centrioles recruits ZYG-1 (Plk4-like), which triggers SAS-6/SAS-5 cartwheel assembly, followed by SAS-4 addition to build the centriole cylinder.
- Pericentriolar material (PCM) scaffolds (SPD-2, SPD-5, PCMD-1) mature around the centrioles, recruiting γ-tubulin/γ-TuRC and concentrating soluble tubulin (~10×) as the embryo approaches mitosis.
- Astral microtubule (MT) nucleation capacity scales with PCM size; MT numbers per centrosome rise from ~10^3 early to ~10^4 at metaphase.
- Event timing depends strongly on temperature (Arrhenius-like scaling); therefore fixed minute thresholds are fragile across conditions. A state-based guard (S phase + licensing markers) is preferred over a hard time cutoff.

Timing anchors (20–22 °C context)
- S phase of the first cycle begins soon after meiotic exit and finishes before pronuclear meeting; duplication licensing occurs in this window (well before polarity establishment).
- Polarity establishment is typically ~20–30 min post-fertilization; first cleavage ~40 min. These are later than duplication licensing and should not be used as the “earliest duplication” gate.

Quantitative structural/functional context
- MTs per centrosome: thousands pre-NEBD, peaking at >10,000 at metaphase; local tubulin near the PCM: ~470 µM soluble + ~230 µM polymer (~660 µM total) at metaphase.
- γ-TuRC counts per zygote centrosome are not directly reported; cryo-ET shows atypical ~11-fold symmetry γ-TuRC-like minus ends in embryo PCM, consistent with many nucleation-competent sites. A practical prior for active nucleators at metaphase is ~3×10^3–1.2×10^4.

Implication for validation
- A biologically faithful guard should prevent duplication outside S phase and in the absence of licensing markers (CDK-2/CYE-1 activity + SPD-2 at centrioles + ZYG-1 localization; block re-duplication once SAS-6 cartwheel is present), rather than using a fixed minute threshold.
