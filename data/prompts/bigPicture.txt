This file gives a big-picture summary of the main interactions in this codebase. It is intentionally simple.

- DNA (in the Nucleus): transcribes MRNA molecules (per gene expression rates).
- MRNA: exported from the Nucleus into the internal cytosolic (fluid portion of the cytoplasm) Medium, diffuses, and degrades over time.
- TranslationInteraction: uses MRNA (plus tRNAs/ATP) to produce PROTEIN molecules.
- Proteins in the Medium:
  - Diffuse when unbound.
  - Can bind to the Cortex (membrane) and become “bound” (no 3D diffusion while bound).
  - Participate in ComplexFormationInteraction (e.g., PAR-3:PAR-6, PAR-6:PKC-3).
  - Undergo phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (interaction rates from data/proteinRules).

- Cortex (cell membrane):
  - Holds bound protein populations (e.g., PAR-3:CORTEX, PAR-2:CORTEX).
  - PAR proteins exhibit mutual antagonism:
    - PAR-6:PKC-3 excludes posterior PARs (PAR-1/PAR-2).
    - PAR-1 excludes anterior PAR-3.
  - Polarization is read out via anterior/posterior ratios of cortex-bound PARs.

- Centrosome and microtubules (posterior cue; in progress/refinement):
  - The sperm centrosome nucleates microtubules that reach the posterior cortex.
  - Local MT(MicroTubules)-cortex proximity/contact reduces posterior RHO-1/ECT-2 activity (AIR-1/Aurora A pathway) and stabilizes PAR-2.
  - Lower local contractility at the posterior can drive anterior-directed cortical flows (planned/refined model).

- CellSim and mechanics:
  - CellSim integrates chemistry/biology each step.
  - TensionSphere represents cortex shape; force constants can be adjusted from molecular state.

- Data collection and validation:
  - DataCollector samples specific molecules at defined positions over time (CSV).
  - Validation checks compare simulated patterns (e.g., PAR A/P ratios, centrosome behavior) against expected biological trends.
